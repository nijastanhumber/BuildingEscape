# Building Escape

A simple First Person game to learn level building, lighting, Unreal Editor, C++ game logic, basic Blueprint and more.

This is a tutorial series from Udemy's Unreal Engine course. The link is at [here](www.udemy.com/Unreal-Engine/Unreal-Engine). It teaches how to use UE4 using C++ mainly.

Very helpful and I'd recommend it to anyone!
